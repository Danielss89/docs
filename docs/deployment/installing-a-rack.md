A [Rack](/docs/rack) is a private PaaS installed into your AWS account. Once you have a Rack running you can use it to deploy and manage your applications and backing resources. The following steps will guide you through installation.

* Browse to the [Convox Console](https://console.convox.com/).
* Choose the desired Organization from the dropdown in the top navigation.
* Make sure you have the [AWS Integration](/docs/aws-integration) enabled in your organization.
* Click on Racks in the main navigation and then click the  <img src="/assets/images/docs/add-rack-new.png" alt="Add Rack" style="height: 1.5em;"> button and select your AWS account.
* Choose a name for your Rack, and select the desired AWS region.
* If you need [advanced configuration options](/reference/rack-parameters) you can click on add parameter and assign additional parameters for your 
Rack.
* Click **Install Rack**.

Once launched, installation will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
